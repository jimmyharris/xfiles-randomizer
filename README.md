# An X-Files monster of the week randomizer script

This script will eventually use data from the xfiles wikia as well as possibly other sources (imdb?)
that will be used to create a button that can be pushed to randomly select an eposide of the non
conspiracy x-files episodes to watch.

It is primarily being written in python on iOS.
